      title: 'Transanal removal of a broken drinking glass self-inserted and retained in the rectum.',
      authors: ['Lazzari V', 'Siboni S', 'Asti E', 'Bonavina L'],
      date: '2 Jun 2017',
      abstract: 'Retained rectal foreign bodies are increasingly reported in current clinical practice, and there is no clear consensus in the literature as to whether transanal extraction should be performed in the emergency or in the operating room. A 47-year-old presented to the hospital for a retained drinking glass in the rectum that was broken after an attempt at self-extraction. Physical examination showed no evidence of abdominal guarding nor bleeding from the rectum; abdominal and pelvic X-rays confirmed the presence of a broken glass, 8×6 cm in size and no signs of perforation. Initial anoscopy performed in the emergency room confirmed the partial fracture of the glass. The patient was transferred to the operating room and transanal extraction was carried out under general anaesthesia without complications.',

      title: 'Solitons and their stability in the nonlocal nonlinear Schrödinger equation with PT-symmetric potentials.',
      authors: ['Wen Z', 'Yan Z'],
      date: '27 May 2017',
      abstract: 'We report localized nonlinear modes of the self-focusing and defocusing nonlocal nonlinear Schrödinger equation with the generalized PT-symmetric Scarf-II, Rosen-Morse, and periodic potentials. Parameter regions are presented for broken and unbroken PT-symmetric phases of linear bounded states and the linear stability of the obtained solitons. Moreover, we numerically explore the dynamical behaviors of solitons and find stable solitons for some given parameters.',

      title: 'Nuclear Microprobe Mapping of Statoliths of Chokka Squid Loligo vulgaris reynaudii Orbigny, 1845.',
      authors: ['Durholtz MD', 'Lipinski MR', 'Przybylowicz WJ', 'Mesjasz-Przybylowicz J.'],
      date: 'Oct 197',
      abstract: 'Loliginid squid statoliths were broken in half and their elemental composition was assessed using the nuclear microprobe technique. Proton induced X-ray emission and proton backscattering were used simultaneously. True, quantitative maps of calcium and strontium distribution in the frontal plane were obtained using a rapid-matrix-transform method called Dynamic Analysis. These measurements were complemented by observations with scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy. In juvenile and adult statoliths, Sr was concentrated in the wing and adjacent areas, whereas the Ca concentration was highest on the edge of the lateral dome. In contrast, Sr and Ca were uniformly distributed in the statoliths of paralarval squid. Increments showed best definition in the areas anterior and adjacent to the wing, corresponding to areas of high Sr content. Although temperature, sex, maturity, and the administration of oxytetracycline may influence the quantitative distribution of Ca and Sr in the statoliths of adult squid, they do not appear to affect the general pattern described above. The finding that Sr is concentrated in regions adjacent to the macula where the clearest increments are found in loliginid statoliths supports the hypothesis linking strontium with the regulation of statolith deposition and the definition of daily increments.',
